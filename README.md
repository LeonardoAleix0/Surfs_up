# **Surfs_Up**

## Overview of Project
This projectâ€™s objective is to analyse the weather on the island of Oahu in Hawaii to support a business venture. The business is described as an ice cream store that sells surfboards and surf apparel to locals and tourists. The deliverables for this project are:

*	Determine the Summary Statistics for June.
* 	Determine the Summary statistics for December.

## Software
Python 3.7.7, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask. 

## Results

The Summary Statistics shows that for the month of June, the average temperature is 74 degrees Fahrenheit reaching the maximum temperature of 85 degrees Fahrenheit.  This data is based on 1700 recorded temperatures for the month of June from 2010 to 2017. The low standard deviation indicates a consistent weather temperature.
Summer in Hawaii starts mid June through August but as the island is located in the tropics, the warmer temperatures usually last from May to October.

### Determine the Summary statistics for December.

The Summary Statistics shows that for the month of December, the average temperature is 71 degrees Fahrenheit reaching the maximum temperature of 83 degrees Fahrenheit.  This data is based on 1517 recorded temperatures for the month of December from 2010 to 2017. The low standard deviation indicates a consistent weather temperature.
Winter in Hawaii starts mid December through mid April. Although the overall temperature is around the low 80s during the day, the evenings can get a little chilly. 

## Summary

The Summary Statistics shows that June and December have similar warm weather. The low standard deviation for both months is an indication of reliable weather. 
The rainy season happens during the winter time, from November to April but the island does not experience a drop in tourism levels. Winter in Hawaii is known to have lower prices compared with the summer months which causes the winter season to be a high tourist season. Analysing 18103 observations for precipitation from all the months of the years from 2010 to 2017 one can conclude that the rainy season is not an issue for the new venture.
